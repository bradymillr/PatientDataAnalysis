## Overview
**Tableau Dashboard -** [Link]()

**Dataset -** When looking for a dataset with some depth where I could derive insights with the caveat of it being already well-maintained, I came across this [Patient Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blueblushed/hospital-dataset-for-practice) and knew it would be a great fit for this project. This dataset is a historical record of patients being seen at a hospital with many demographic variables.

**My Rationale For Choosing This Dataset -** The reason I decided on this dataset is because I wanted to build a project with a different type of data than my other projects, and I feel that the insights that can be derived from analyzing healthcare data is both applicable and very useful for hospitals and patients alike to know. 

***This dataset includes a number of fields including:***
- Patient_Id
- Age
- Gender
- Procedure: The procedure undertaken
- Cost: Cost of said procedure
- Length of Stay (in days)
- Readmission (Yes or No)
- Outcome (Recovered or Stable)
- Satisfaction (Ranging from 2-5 but presumably on a 1-5 scale)

## Questions

**1.** What are the most prevalent conditions among different age groups?

**2.** Is there a correlation between length of stay and satisfaction?

**3.** Which conditions have the highest readmission rates?

**4.** How does patient satisfaction differ between those with positive and negative outcomes?

**5.** What is the average cost per condition?

**6.** What is the average cost for the highest five and lowest five satisfaction scores?

**7.** How do patient satisfaction scores vary by gender for different conditions?

**8.** Which procedures have the highest success rates?

**9.** Do low satisfaction scores correlate with negative outcome probabilites?

**10.** What is the most common procedure and associated cost by gender?
